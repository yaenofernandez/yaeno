                <p class="lead">One of the most glamorous and romantic cinemas in London.</p>
                <p class="lead">The Electric Cinema in Portobello showcases a lavish cinematic experience inside a beautiful historic building. Opening in the early 1900's, the building has survived two world wars, a bombing, and a major fire; it garnered world-wide recognition for the phenomenal programming in the 70s; and it was saved from being turned into a Bingo Hall in the 1980s thanks to an outpouring of local support. With a wide variety of both current and classic films, its own bar, and cashmere blankets for everyone, snuggle up on the double bed style seating with a friend or a loved one while you get swept into a whole other world</p>
